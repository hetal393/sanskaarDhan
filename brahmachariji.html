                    <p>He Had Extraordinary Equanimity, while returning from Bombay he was standing by the door of A Train Compartment in Baroda talking to his Mentor Motibhai and Others, when someone suddenly closed the door and his Thumb got Shorn. He
                        did not say anything to the Person and Quietly Endured the Pain. Having Developed Great Enthusiasm for Securing India’s Independence He disregarded his Family’s Expectation of Working for the Government as such Employment Amounted
                        Slavery to the British Regime. In Vaso he set up the First Kindergarten Of Gujarat which taught on the Basis of the Montessori Education system. He Even Trained the Teachers. Within A Year or Two, Charotar Education Society was
                        Established with their Headquarters and Own School in Anand. The School had to be Affiliated with Vidiyapeeth, Ghandhiji’s Movement of Non-Cooperation. The School Name Changed To D.N Vidiyamandir and the Head was Designated Acharya.
                        Govardhanbhai Felt Unbecoming To Be Called An ‘acharya- The One Who Observes Perfect Conduct. He Deeply Contemplated On The Qualities And Conduct Required To Be An Acharya Of Hundreds Of Students. Therefore He Was Eager to go to
                        Shri Aurobindo Or Other Great Saints to Elevate His Development And Level. But After Visiting Various Saints, He Concluded Agas Ashram Saint- Shri Prabhushriji as His Guru/ Mentor.

                    <p>During Diwali Vacations he went Home. There He came to know about Shrimadji and Lalluji Swami through his Relative Bhagwanbhai, Hencebhe was keen to go to Shrimad Rajchandra Ashram, Agas. He Prayed to God to Show him the True and Original
                        Path. On Kali Chaudash with Bhagwanbhai they went to Agas. Lalluji Muni was Seated Under the Rayan Tree Singing ‘Mul Marag’ and at First Instance he Felt Peace at Heart. Prabhushriji knew his Mind and affectionately gave The Mantra
                        (Essence Of 14 Purvas) to him. Shrimad once told Prabhushriji in Advance that Kali Chaudas and Sunday-Such Combination Comes very Rarely. Coincidentally when Pujyashriji got the Mantra From Param Pujya Prabhushriji, It was the
                        Same Day as Forecasted By Shrimad. Prabhushriji was in a True Bliss whilst giving this Mantra to Pujyashriji. He formed undivided Devotion and spent his free time in spritual pursuit.

                    <!-- <h5>1867</h5> -->
                    <p>His Inclination to Renounce the Worldly Life kept Intensifying, but was hesitant because of the Responsibility of his Son. then he wrote A long letter to his Brother Narsinh bhai, expressing his Eagerness to give up the worldly Life
                        to stay forever at the Service of Prabhushriji for Self Realisation. When Prabhushriji said there was a lot of Work for him, he could no longer wait and on getting his Brother’s Consent, he resigned from Charotar Education Society
                        and joined The Ashram in June 1925. His Devotion, Perseverance, Obedience, Focus, Composure,Compassion and many Other Incredible Qualities kept Growing, Developing and were Simply Exemplary. He Continuously Stayed at the Service
                        of Prabhushriji and hardly slept for 1 - 1.5 Hours a Day, but still Blissing all the Time. Shrimadji Has Stated, “Celibacy Is Helpful And Is Of Fundamental Significance For Accomplishing Composure Over Conduct, For Averting All
                        Types Of Indolences, For Uninterruptedly Maintaining The Inclinations Within The Soul And To Triumph All The Methods Regarding Liberation.” Hence Gordhanbhai Took the Vow of Celibacy from Prabhushriji. Thereafter Prabhushriji addressed
                        him as Bhramachari, Therefore everyone identified him as ‘Bhramachariji’ rather than Gordhanbhai.</p>

                    <p>Laghuraj Swami knew he had limited time left. In Samvant 1992 (1936 A.D.) he instructed Bhramachariji As Follows: “I am now giving you the Responsibility for the continuity of Shrimad's Mokshmarg to Bless and Guide all the New Seekers".
                        Regarding the Divine Qualities of Bhramachariji as a Spiritual Leader, Shri Laghuraj Swami told Manekji Sheth in Presence of 50-60 Mumukshus in Samvat 1979 (1923 A.D.) as follows: “Before My Time Is Up, I Will Have One Brahmchari
                        To Join Me In This Spiritual Journey In Agas Ashram For 11 Years In My Service And He Will Show This Divine Path And Guide Thousands Of Seekers In The Future. All Of You Will Be Able To Feel Comfortable To Confide In Him As You
                        Have Confided In Me.” At the Age Of 82, Laghuraj Swami took Samadhi and the Responsibility of entire Sangh fell on the Shoulders of Shri Bhramachariji. His Delicate Heart was Soaked in Deep Sorrows Experiencing Huge Loss of Laghuraj
                        Swami. In these Delicate Moments Of Solitude, Shri Bhramachariji attained Divine Enlightenment on the 8th Day Of Jeth Vad 1993 (1937 A.D.), Once Again we see The Student Becomes The Master.

                    <h2>Work Of Pujyashri ji after Prabushri Ji</h2>
                    <!-- <h5>1867</h5> -->
                    <p>After Attaining this Divine State of Self-Realization, Pujya Shri Bhramachariji Composed many Scriptures including Pragnavabodh, Biography Of Shrimad, In Depth Translation Of Samadhi Shatak and Atmasiddhi Shastra, Poetic Translations
                        Of Vivekbavani, Gyansaar, Lagu Yogvashistha and several other Poetic Compositions are compiled in the Alochana text. He has done Interpretation of many letters of Shrimadji in Simple Language. Shri Bhramachariji’s Heart was so
                        purified by his Devotion (Guru-Bhakti) to Shrimadji that his teachings and writings have Divine Power to Awaken A Seeker Instantly as Experienced by this writer. Bhramachariji often gave this advise to all his Seekers: “A Study
                        Of Jain Agam Texts and other Scriptures without A Clear Understanding Of Shrimadji’s Teachings (Vachanamrut Text) will not provide the Right Perspective. Pujyashri On Last Few Days : On Samvat 2010 (1954 A.D.) On the Day Of Kartik
                        Sud Pacham, Pujya Shri Brahmchariji asked for forgiveness to all the Seekers present in Agas Ashram. On Kartik Sud Six, Pujyashri told everyone in his Talk, “We have to Prepare For Samadhi-Maran. We Should Be Brave and not get
                        worked up or afraid in facing Death but Surrender to Shrimadji. We should engage the mind in Mantra-Smaran and be ready for Departing our Soul from this Body in Maha-Samadhi”. On Kartik Sud Seventh Of Samvat 2010, Pujyashriji went
                        to Rajmandir. He stood up in Samadhi Posture and his Soul left his Body to enter Eternity. Secrets that Remain Memorable : He always remained Vigil and left no Stone Unturned in Overcoming Character-Related Delusion. When he went
                        to Idar, Mt Abu, Girnar on pilgrimage, he spent the nights in terrific wilderness. In simarda he passed continuos nights in kausagaa at risky places. Later in life he lost his eyesight in one eye, yet people only realised it after
                        six months, similarly they found out about his acute wrist and foot pain a year and a half later, also his neurotic system was affected after being slapped at raj mandir by an evil spirit that was only discovered after his death.
                        His life indicated that spiritualism is not merely bare verbal knowledge; it is the vigilant, meaningful endeavour for a delighted life. To him the devotion for param krupaludev was the great endeavour for realising the self.
