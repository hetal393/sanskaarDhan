                    <p>At the age of seven, young Raichand first encountered death through the sudden passing of an acquaintance. Curious to know the meaning of death, He climbed a babul tree near the crematorium. Witnessing the body burning on the funeral
                        pyre, He slipped into an intense churning so profound that it led to the attainment of Jatismaranjnan – a recollection of hundreds of past lives.</p>

                    <p>Raichand began school and completed seven years of academic study in just two years. Besides His remarkable intelligence, He was endowed with creative spontaneity, poetic, and oratory prowess. He was fondly known as ‘Kavi’ – the child
                        scholar-poet. Between 13 to 16 years, He delved into His quest for the ultimate truth through an immersive study of the scriptures and mastering the six principle Indian philosophies.</p>
