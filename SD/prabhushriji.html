                        <p class="mb-4">Shrimad met some monks who were deeply impressed by his understanding of the scriptures when he visited Cambay in about 1891. One monk, named Lalluji Maharaj, later known as Laghuraj Swami, had already heard of him. Laghuraj Swami
                            also known as prabhushree gained self-relaization by getting conviction of self through the graceful lord Shrimad Rajchandra, the great philosopher and spiritualism incarnate. Laghuraj Swami had whole-hearted faith in Shrimad,
                            just as a true disciple should have in a true Guru. There is much to be learnt from Laghuraj Swami and from the correspondence and instruction he received from Shrimad.

                        on attaining moksh and would do anything. He did business of money lending, some corrupt minded people avoided to repay, still he never got furious.

                        jain diksha. His guruji pujya harakhchandji of sthanak vasi denomination was sedulious and very disciplined. He fasted for 5 long years under guru’s aagya but did not attain samkit (differentiation of body and soul). due to his
                        behaviour, he became prominent in the jain community. He knew he was lacking true spritual guidance for attaining self realisation even though he left the wordly bliss and was preaching many others. His heart was in hunt for a
                        true master to guide him on the spritiual path to attain self realisation.

                    <p>There was a spritiual awekening in his life at the age of 36 when he met Shrimad Rajchandraji personally. In his first meet with Shrimadji he felt a devine spark and found what he was seeking i.e a true master! He being a 36 year old,
                        Laghuraj Swamiji bowed to 22 year old Shrimad Rajchandraji. `eyes of a geniune disciple can recognize the true master` -patra 254, vachanamruth. He solicitated for self realiastion to Shrimad. He also asked for firmness in celibacy
                        and samkit (differentiation of soul and body) Shrimad sprinkled his blessings by giving him an extraordinary mantra! (to know about that mantra, kindly visit agas ashram), spritual letters, sermonsetc...In Mumbai, Shrimadji endorsed
                        him with first 17 verses of gathas from "samadhi shatak" by “pujiya pad swami ji”, he explained and even gave him a powerfull mantra. In samvat 1950 (1895 A.D.), muni felt that he may not survive due to illness. he requested Shrimadji
                        for "samkit" because if we leave our body without attaining samkit , then our soul will be in the cycle of 4 gati. It was for Laghuraj Swami that Shrimad had composed the ‘Letter of Six Fundamentals’ (Chha Pad No Patra).

                    <p>At Ranakpur, one hostile monk told the fellow beings not to offer food and water to Laghuraj Swami, as instructed, they all didn’t give food and water to muni. Muni was neither furious nor was he discontended, because he was on the
                        spritual path by Shrimad and that gave him power to tackle any dubious acts. On the 4th day a sangh had come from khambat and offered food and water to muni. During his travel, he had to pass through a forest, where he was surrounded
                        by Tribals with weapons. Tribals misunderstood muni with Government official dressed as a monk. Muni told them about his travel to a village nearby. On hearing this, tribals were satisfied with his words and left him.

                    <!-- <h5>1867</h5> -->
                    <p>Muni was adversely affected by his bad health, inspite of this he would give unforgettable sermons that puts a mark on seekers which never fades away. He would personally go and help seekers in attaining “samadhi maran” on their last
                        breath. It is said that, “If anyone attains samadhi maran, then he can maximum take 15 births and attain moksh (liberation of soul from the cycle of birth and death)”. Pujiya Bhramachariji was in his service for 11 years and had
                        attained “self realisation “and he handed over the "MAARG" to him. Pujiya Laghuraj swami is like a warranty card of our true master “Shrimad Rajchandra “and the product is “Moksh”. What more does a true seeker seek for?

                    <!-- <h5>1867</h5> -->
                    <p>In the granths written by Muni, messages of his unconditional faith towards shrimadji have been mentioned. Few of them are “Show your utmost respect towards Shrimadji as the real and only true self realized master and spend your life
                        in devotion to him. those who will keep unshakable faith and devotion in Shrimadji’s teachings will attain self realization.” Muni very strongly emphasized this advice “Genuine faith in a self realized sadguru like Shrimadji is
                        found so rare in this descending time, any one who will keep his faith and devotion anchored into Shrimadji's teachings will undoubtedly attain divine bliss according to the immortal words of Lord Mahavir in Uttradhyan Sutra."Right
                        faith in a true sadguru is the most precious gift for a seeker to have in his heart deeply rooted to attain self-realization and moksha.” Muni's gift to seekers: He identified true master of enlighment – “Shrimad Rajchandra“ he
                        established a beautiful place called “Agas Ashram“. Laghuraj swami was popularly known as ‘Prabhushriji’ by everyone in Agas Ashram where he spent more than 14 chaturmas.

                    <p>shrimadji had stated that muni’s samadhi maran would be an extra-ordinary great samadhi maran. On 8th day of vaishak sud (1936 A.D.) Laghuraj swamiji went into the final samadhi at 8 pm while the recitation of “apurva avasar” was carried
                        out by his disciples in Agas Ashram. His soul left this world at age 82 in 1936 A.D. Due to his child like innocence and simplicity, Laghurajswami has been a living testimony as a true disciple of Shrimadji in modern times and
                        blessed thousands of seekers to show the right path to salvation. Greater details of his biography and all his teachings are compiled in the text ‘Updeshamrut’. Pujya Laghuraj swami at last handed over the religion to Pujya Bramhchariji.
