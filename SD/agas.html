                    <h2><br>Shri Sanatan Jain Dharma Shrimad Rajchandra Ashram</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Ashram is established by Pujya Shri Laghurajswami (Param Pujya Prabhushriji) in Vikram
                            Era 1976
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Age: More than 100 years ago. Shrimad Rajchandraji himself had forecasted that this will be
                            a Punya Bhumi.
                        </li>
                        <li>Param Pujya Prabushriji was endorsed by Shrimad as a True Gyaani.</li>
                        <li>
                            Shrimad handed over to Param Pujya Prabhushriji for enforcement of a True religion and then
                            P.P. Prabhushriji handed it over to Pujya Bramhchariji. Thereafter, no further handover has
                            been seen, as this place is reserved only for Aatmagyaani. But both
                            Prabhushriji and Pujya Bramhchariji never considered them as a Guru but endorsed Shrimadji
                            as Our Only Guru.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Motto of this Ashram to get burn the seed of all the sorrows majorly birth and death cycle.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Uniqueness of the Ashram</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Despite no Physical Pratyaksh Guru but what is definitely present here is Aagya of a
                            Pratyaksh True Guru.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The whole Aaradhna Kram of more than 10 hours is designed by P.P. Prabhushriji. There has
                            mainly been no change in the kram since more than 100 years.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The “Pratishta” of this Ashram was done under the supervision of P.P. Prabhushriji.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Aaradhna Kram comprises of Devotional Bhakti, Taatvik Bhakti, Aalochana / Pratikraman,
                            Various Holy Bhaavnas, Satsang etc. This is the Agya Kram given by Gyani.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Ashram has a huge library of Religious Books.</li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prabhushriji himself said that this place is a strongest reason for Samadhi Maran. He has
                            set a 36 Maala Aaradhna Kram for Samadhi Maran which is a sure shot reason for the Samadhi
