                        hundred tasks simultaneously) at Sir Framji Cawasji Institute on 22 January, 1887 in Mumbai, at an age of nineteen. But when he realized that the fame is causing distraction on his spiritual progress, he declined to perform any
                        other avdhaan in his life. Shrimad married Zabakben, daughter of Popatlal, the elder brother of Revashankar Jagjivandas Mehta, a Zaveri merchant family. He then engaged in the pearls and diamond business.</p>
